# Sphinx
Sphinx is a color image encryption system that utilizes NCA map-based CML and a one-time key. This system converts an image into a DNA sequence, which is encrypted using Sphinx's advanced algorithms. The encrypted data is then stored as an image, ensuring secure transmission and storage of sensitive data.
